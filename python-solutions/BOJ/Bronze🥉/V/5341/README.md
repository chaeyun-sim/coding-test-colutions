## 문제
A pyramid of blocks is constructed by first building a base layer of n blocks and then adding n-1 blocks to the next layer. This process is repeated until the top layer only has one block.
You must calculate the number of blocks needed to construct a pyramid given the size of the base. For example, a pyramid that has a base of size 4 will need a total of 10 blocks.
